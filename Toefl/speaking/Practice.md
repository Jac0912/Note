Do you agree or disagree with the following statement? A university's academic reputation is the most important thing a student should consider in deciding which university to attend. Use examples and details to support your opinion.
Well, in my opinion, I believe that **a** university's reputation is the first thing that a freshman should consider.
For example, a university with good academic reputation could provide fantastic research ~~atomsphare~~ **atmosphare** ~~to students~~, which literally allows students **to** acquire ~~meaningfull~~ **meaningful** research experience. Also, students could **have** ~~acquire precious chance~~ **valuable opportunities** to learn from famous professor**s** for the reason that great academic reputation **is** partially bulit up by famous professors.
In contrast, students can't get the benefits mentioned above in a university with ~~bad~~ **poor** reputation.

One of the most important books I have ever read is Journey to the West. 
The main character, the Monkey King, faces countless challenges on his journey to get Buddhist scriptures, but he never gives up. His courage and determination inspire me to stay strong when I face difficulties in my own life.
Also, the story shows how people with very different personalities can work together toward one goal. For example, the Monkey King, Pigsy, and Sandy often argue, but they still cooperate in the end. This helped me understand the value of teamwork in real life.

Also (In addition), watching television ~~could help~~ **allows** them **to** get the latest news of the world for the reason that it's convenien~~ce~~**t** to get information from the Universal channel.
In contrast, people can't get the benefits above without watching television.
