One of the most important books I have ever read is Journey to the West. 
The main character, the Monkey King, faces countless challenges on his journey to get Buddhist scriptures, but he never gives up. His courage and determination inspire me to stay strong when I face difficulties in my own life.
Also, the story shows how people with very different personalities can work together toward one goal. For example, the Monkey King, Pigsy, and Sandy often argue, but they still cooperate in the end. This helped me understand the value of teamwork in real life.

I believe that television has a positive influence on society simply because it's **one of** the easiest way**s** to learn.
For example, **during** last summer vacation, my parents acquired some knowledge of home fire safety from watching television. After that, they **stared** checking the ~~state~~ condition of electric**al** appliances **more** frequently, which ~~is important to~~  **helped them become more**  aware of ~~the~~ potential danger**s**. Also (In addition), watching television ~~could help~~ **allows** them **to** get the latest news of the world for the reason that it's convenien~~ce~~**t** to get information from the Universal channel.
In contrast, people can't get the benefits above without watching television.
