In the lecture, the professor casts doubt on the reading passage's idea that it's impossible for humans to survive on Venus. The professor asserts that if a station could be built high enough above Venus' ground, many problems would be solved.  
Firstly, the passage claims that massive atmospheric pressure on Venus' ground will crush everything. However, the professor disputes this theory, stating that a station so far away from Venus' ground will suffer much lower atmospheric pressure, which can even be equal to the atmospheric pressure on Earth.  
Additionally, the author of the passage points out that water and oxygen, which are essential to human life, cannot be produced on Venus. Nonetheless, the professor counters this by pointing out that there are massive compounds within Venus' atmosphere which can be used to produce water and oxygen.  
Lastly, the lecturer challenges the reading passage's claim that, because the thick clouds prevent the sunlight from reaching Venus' surface, it is impossible to power the cells that need sunlight. On the contrary, the professor contends that clouds in the upper atmosphere are much thinner, so it is not that difficult for sunlight to get through. What is more, the sunlight that is reflected by clouds on both sides can be used to generate power.


In the lecture, the professor casts doubt on the reading passage's idea that there is no denying that Peary successfully made his journey to the North Pole. The professor asserts that the three reasons from the passage are not convincing enough to prove that Peary actually made this significant journey.
Firstly, the passage claims that a committee asserted that Peary's claim was genuine after it conducted  thorough research. However, the professor disputes this theory, stating that most of the committee members were friends of Peary, and had provided him with financial assistance. Without doubt, it is impossible for the committee to make an objective assessment about Peary's record. Moreover, the committee spent only two days on this investigation, which was not enough to examine all the details.
Additionally, the author of the passage points out that Tom Avery has proved that it is not unbelievable for Peary to finish the trip in 37 days. Nonetheless, the professor counters this by pointing out that because Tom Avery got food supply from an airplane, which made his bag much lighter. What is more, the weather was far better when Tom Avery was undertaking his journey than Peary's expedition.  
Lastly, the lecturer challenges the reading passage's claim that the position of the sun in Peary's photo could confirm that Peary actually reached the North Pole. On the contrary, the professor contends that though we can use technology to analyze the shadows in the photo to compute if it was taken at the North Pole, it is difficult to precisely distinguish the shadows from a blurry picture because a long time has passed.
