In the lecture, the professor casts doubt on the reading passage's idea that there are three ways to resolve the over salinity of the Salton Sea. The professor asserts that each of these methods has significant drawbacks that make it unrealistic to save the lake.  

Firstly, the passage claims that by using facilities to move and evaporate the water, the salt can be removed easily from the lake. However, the professor disputes this theory, stating that because some toxic chemical materials mixed with the salt left behind will dissipate into the air, it can cause serious health issues when people breathe in them.  

Additionally, the author of the passage points out that the water from the Pacific Ocean, which is less salty than that of the lake, can be delivered to dilute the lake's saltiness. Nonetheless, the professor counters this by pointing that due to the long distance of the ocean (100km away), the government does not have sufficient resources to construct pipelines or canals to deliver the water from the Pacific Ocean.  

Lastly, the lecturer challenges the reading passage's claim that the salinity can be reduced by building walls to divide the lake. On the contrary, the professor contends that this method cannot be used in the long-term. Given that strong geological events in this area occur frequently, walls will be broken down, which literally means that the water in the dividing area will flow back into the main section of the lake.
